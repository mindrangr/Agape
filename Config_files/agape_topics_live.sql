He was a military veteran who had served in Afghanistan, and he kept an arsenal in his home that included bomb-making materials.<br><br>\r\nThe gunman turned a demonstration against fatal police shootings this week of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana from a peaceful march focused on violence committed by officers into a scene of chaos and bloodshed aimed against them.<br><br>\r\nThe shooting was the kind of retaliatory violence that people have feared through two years of protests around the country against deaths in police custody, forcing yet another wrenching shift in debates over race and criminal justice that had already deeply divided the nation.<br><br>\r\nTwo witnesses to the shooting at a march against police brutality on Thursday evening in Dallas described the moment gunfire and panic broke out. Five police officers were killed. <br><br>\r\nDemonstrations continued Friday in cities across the country, with one of the largest taking place on the streets of Atlanta, where thousands of people protesting police abuse brought traffic to a standstill.<br><br>\r\nJeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, said in New York that there was apparently just one sniper, though there were so many gunshots and so many victims that officials at first speculated about multiple shooters.<br><br>\r\nOfficials said they had found no evidence that the gunman, Micah Johnson, 25, had direct ties to any protest or political group, either peaceful or violent, but his Facebook page showed that he supported the New Black Panther Party, a group that has advocated violence against whites, and Jews in particular.<br><br>\r\nSearching the killer’s home on Friday, “detectives found bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition, and a personal journal of combat tactics,” the Dallas Police Department said in a statement.<br><br>\r\nThree other people were arrested in connection with the shooting, but the police would not name them or say why they were being held.<br><br>\r\nIn addition to the five officers who died, seven officers and two civilians were wounded. The Police Department said that 12 officers had returned fire during a wild series of gun battles that stretched for blocks.<br><br>\r\nAfter the shooting subsided, Mr. Johnson, wielding an assault rifle and a handgun, held the police off for hours in a parking garage, claiming — apparently falsely — to have planted explosives in the area, and threatening to kill more officers. In the end, the police killed him Friday morning with an explosive delivered by a remote-controlled robot, the Dallas police chief, David O. Brown, said.<br><br>\r\nDuring the standoff, Mr. Johnson, who was black, told police negotiators that “he was upset about Black Lives Matter,” Chief Brown said. “He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.”<br><br>\r\nMr. Johnson, who lived in the Dallas area, served as a private in the Army Reserve from March 2009 to April 2015, according to records released by the Pentagon. He was listed as a carpentry and masonry specialist, and served in Afghanistan from November 2013 to July 2014.<br><br>\r\nThe sequence of events this week provoked anger and despair, dealing blows both to law enforcement and to peaceful critics of the police, who have fended off claims that the outcry over police shootings foments violence and puts officers’ lives in danger.<br><br>\r\n“All I know is that this must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens,” Chief Brown said.', 'Wisp007', '2016-07-12 00:00:00', 6363, '[]', 0, 0, 'the Wisp', 'newsImages/policeshooting.jpg', 5522, 5522, 'Current Events', 'Article', 'None', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'Active', '[]'),

He is a strong opposition to Hillary Clinton who is already the presumptive democratic nominee.<br><br>\n Bernie Sanders who is already 73 years hints that he intends to reduce the inequality rate. Our fingers are crossed as the days roll by. However on a lighter note here are 5 things you should know about Bernie Sanders<br><br>\n1. Marched for civil rights during his college year- In 1962 Under Sander’s chairmanship the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee held a rally to protest President George Well Beadles segregation campus housing policy.<br><br>\n2. He was first married to Deborah Shilling- In 1963 he meet Deborah Shilling in college, they got married in 1964 and later divorced in 1966. They had no children<br><br>\n3. He is an artist as well as a musician- In 1967 he recorded a folk album titled “We shall overcome” and he appeared in a cameo role in a 1988 comedy drama film “Sweet Hearts Dance”. He was also a star guest with Larry David on Saturday Night Live where he played the role of a polish immigrant.<br><br>\n4. He is as much a Socialist as he is a Zionist- Many of Sander’s actions points to him as being a Zionist, He had a bar-mitzvah as a boy, and in 1963 he volunteered at sha’ar HaAmakin in Israel, as mayor of Burlington he allowed a Chabad public Menorah to be placed at city hall. He publicly inaugurated Hanukah menorah and performed Jewish religious ritual of blessing Hanukah candles.<br><br>\n5.

It began decades ago and its domino effect is yet to be seen.<br><br>\nThe EU has been a stronghold for all its members in international affairs and much of its effect has been enjoyed by smaller and deprived members. In the past the UK had enjoyed substantial benefits as part of being a member of the EU. However now that the tide is turning they are taking to their heels.\nHowever I view it, I do not blame the UK for wanting to leave. Of all the members of the EU, the UK suffers the worst disadvantages of being a member. From the high cost of membership which runs into £15 billion annually and the rising issue of Net Immigration which is amounting to congestion, high cost of housing and inflation. These amongst other factors have Britons worried as to their future. <br><br>\nBut what will the future look like without UK in the EU?\nBill Bryson a renowned US born author was quoted as saying that\n “Now, the British have become more greedy and selfish, more like the American model, except they haven’t quite mastered it yet.”\nHe referred to the decision to leave the EU as more of an emotional decision rather than a logical one.<br><br>\nTo a large extent I am forced to agree with Bill Bryson the Domino effect of UK leaving the EU will soon sweep through Europe. UK is one of the largest economies and contributors to the EU, one of the most popular and out spoken countries in the EU. That many other smaller EU countries look up to.\nWhat do you expect when the head or leader grows cold feet’s and runs away?<br><br> \nThe others will eventually pick up the thread. Problem is the effect this decision will have on smaller and deprived EU countries and on Europe generally. All of these are what should have been taken into perspective before the EU referendum.', 'the Wisp', '2016-07-12 00:00:00', 1423, '[]', 0, 0, 'the Wisp', 'newsImages/britishPrimeminister.jpg', 5522, 5522, 'Current Events', 'Article', 'None', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'Active', '[]'),

(7, '2016-07-25 14:00:00', 'David Clarke: A black face on Police outrage. Nothing to see here.', 'I finally got a chance to see the David Clarke interview with Don Lemon on cnn.com<br/> <br/>David Clarke turned out to be every bit as revolting as Willie D made him out be in his coon song. You see, I''d never heard of David Clarke before that song so watching him shine shoes for the first time put me in awe. I''ve seen some tap dancing and coonin in my time but this sorry negro is the worst I''ve seen in years. Seeing his coonin talent makes you unconsciously start comparing him to the all time great coons like Clarence Thomas in the way that seeing Lebron James for the first time made you compare him to Jordan. This may sound crass. You may even roll your eyes like here we go with this, but be not fooled by David Clarkes merit badge filled uniform. He is their to place a black face on police outrage. Outrage over what? That blacks, of all people, should question them and the way they choose to go about their work.<br/> <br/>                                                      David Clarke is an over emotional, praise seeking brat. He started the interview with an aggressive attitude that turned me off immediately. He flew into this unwarranted rant against Don Lemon whose only connection with Black Lives Matter is the fact that he''s black and Black Lives Matter has black in the name. Lemon tried to tell him as much but David Clarke wasn''t their for dialogue, he was a tasked attack dog looking to get into a fight over Black Lives Matter with the first black face he saw. And he did.\n<br/> <br/>\nDavid Clarke is so hateful that he actually stapled his name next to the following statement, "racism against blacks ended in the 60&#39;s". Yes, you read that right. This man is not just a coon, he''s stupid. Don''t you know Dave that even racist individuals don''t say stupid stuff like that in public? But I digress, coons aren''t expected to present intelligence to an argument. They are there to wear monkey tails to make white men laugh. See a soldier story to understand that line CJ. \n<br/> <br/>\nNext  Dave would go on to say Black Lives Matter was a terrorist organization. Really? BLM hasn''t killed anyone. The gang that David Clarke belongs to has. Blacks legally unite under the provisions laid out by the constitution to protest and defend against police brutality and now they''re terrorists? Thats what the racist system called Huey P Newton 35 years ago. MLK affectionately earned the name communist 50 years ago by pigs who smell just like David Clark so i suppose that BLM should be proud. But David Clarke carefully choose his words so his ojectives are clear. Shut up and take it black man or we''ll call you a terrorist.\n<br/> <br/>\n\nDave, did you not know that the justice department has opened over 20 cases against local police departments due to corruption, police brutality and racism. That is more than twice as many investigations than were opened in the previous five years, according to the department. Right now the Justice Department has suits pending against local law enforcement agencies in four jurisdictions -- Maricopa, Arizona; Alamance, North Carolina; Colorado City, Arizona; and Meridian, Alabama. Hate to burden you with facts n stuff.\n<br/> <br/>\nThis information isn&#39t hard to find. But officer Clarke doesn&#39t need facts. Not when his job is to place a black face on a racial problem. He certainly wasn&#39;t relying on facts when Don Lemon asked him to provide evidence to support his allegations against BLM, his response, "If the shoe fits". WTF?? This man carries a gun and makes decisions on peoples lives, has 10+ plus years of police experience and this idiot wheels out "If the shoe fits?" We''re talking about a cop making an accusation against a group while in uniform and his evidence is "If the shoe fits?" Seems like the wrong cops got shot.\n<br/> <br/>\nFurther on in the video  officer Clarke would reference some prediction he claimed to have made earlier that "this" would happen. What did the chicken bones tell you about "this" officer Clarke? That there would be blow back in a policing system that on occasion murders its victims and has had systemic racism attached to it since its inception? Thanks Nostradamus. You just predicted history. We played this record 35 years ago with the black Panthers. Remember back when cops USED to be racists. SMH\n<br/> <br/>\nHis final act would be to call the president a liar because the president stated that there were racial issues in the police department. This trash in a badge dishonors the president of the united states but wants America to weep for his "we put on our guns every morning, kiss our wives goodbye and go to protect you" speech. I don''t think so. If you listen closely you''ll hear me playing the worlds smallest violin. That rhetoric after the cases of Charles Kinsey and Michael Stewart fall son deaf ears.  And what about the department of justice department David? They lying too? Everybody is a liar but David Clarke. Got it.\n<br/> <br/>\nThe fact is David Clarke is a crack pot. A conspiracy loon who sees demons in the cereal box. That was one of the reasons he was given a platform to speak. The other, he fits the profile. You know what a profile is don''t you David Clarke? In racially charged situations, the hope is that a black face will better deflect black messages of pain. You didn''t really think it was because you were sharp did you? LOL!! I''ll bet you did. \n<br/> <br/>\nNo David, you are one of those sad cases of racists who is so buried in it you don''t realize how you look and sound. If we were white we''d call you a wigger. Think how stupid they look to white people. Like most self hating racists, you probably fancy yourself equipped with a perfectly good reason for your racism. Just Like fetch and step, Charles Barkley in his now infamous "This is what I tell my white friends" speech, white people can''t stop clapping for and it probably feels pretty good. They found a promoted, self hating black man with a white wife and said dance boy. And just like every other paid for black soul before you, you did just that. And here we were thinking the day of the geechie had passed.\n<br/> <br/>\nSo save your weak indignation and stupid sympathy for cops speeches for people who have a modicum of respect for you and your ilk. A badge will not make a dishonorable man honorable. This isn''t about you being a cop, its about you being a coward. Black Americans know exactly who you are, and why you are their so put away the speeches and go get your banjo and do what comes naturally.', 'Kufu2k', '2016-07-25 00:00:00', 0, '[]', 0, 0, 'Kufu2k', 'newsImages/davidbitchclark.jpg', 5522, 5522, 'Current Events', 'Article', 'None', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'Active', '[]');
