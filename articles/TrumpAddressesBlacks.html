You're unemployed, your schools stink, your neigborhoods stink. The democrats have taken advantage of you. Why not give Trump a chance?</span>
			<br/><br/>
			<span style='letter-spacing:1px;font-size:14px;'>Why not indeed! I can't imagine why every single black American within the sound of his voice weren't instantly ripping those "We love Hillary" bumper stickers right off of their souped up Cadillacs and replacing them with the "We Love the Trump....because we suck" bumper sticker. Who wouldn't be moved after such a compelling speech? Except the speech wasn't compelling at all. It was desperate and insensitive in a way that only Trump can do it.</span>
			<br/><br/>
			<span style='letter-spacing:1px;font-size:14px;'>I certainly understand the why. Donald Trump was advised that the poll numbers were looking bleak and that he'd unfortunately have to reach out for the black vote afterall. He can no longer reach out to the Hispanic community with all this wall talk. He has too harshly offended women (republicans won't make public deals with them either) and the gay vote simply wouldn't provide the numbers. So Trump found himself in the unenviable position of having to reason with a group that he flagrantly ignored for 6 months and as per republican policy couldn't strike a public deal with. So Trumps hands were tied by the very group tasking him with getting more votes. It would end up being too much for Trump to overcome as evidenced by his speech.</span>
			<br/><br/>
			<span style='letter-spacing:1px;font-size:14px;'>Now republicans do negotiate publically. They publically support the NRA. We all know the demographic that the NRA represents. The republicans try and hide the fact they routinely reach out to a demographic made up mainly of white, middle class males and by changing the narrative to say that they are supporting  the ammendments. But their laser focus on only the second one makes it painfully obvious who they are in bed with. Republicans will also make public deals with the rich as they always have. Lowering taxes is a deal. Trump has refused to tax the rich more instead going with political speak "everyone will pay their fair share of taxes". But we know what that means. Trump is smart and rich and he isn't going to cut his own nose off for a 4 year presidency (maybe 8). The rich will get off again. </span>
			<br/><br/>
			<span style='letter-spacing:1px;font-size:14px;'>But when a republican is forced by circumstance to address black voters with no public assurances on hand, its pretty much a wrap. Trump talked about improving schools and unemployment and other usually relevant topics but it just felt late. Trump could have addressed us or even this topic to us for an entire year and he would have had some black voters, not all, but he'd have much more than he does now. But his decision to not offend his mainly white male base until barely 3 months before the election is too little too late. Many of us don't expect much attention from the republican party anyway. But most republican candidates at least pretended to care by granting us the token cameo by addressing the NAACP or some other black institution. Trump never even bothered to pretend he cared which is why his speech was so alarmingly bad. It wasn't necessarily the words he chose as much as his tone. It was the arrogant presumtion that after ignoring us all year that he can now speak to us like family in public. There is a degree of intimacy due before you can criticize African Americans as a group on tv, especially in front of a white crowd, if you want African Americans to hear your message over the criticism. Cosby was able to pull it off and so was Farrakhan. But we don't know Trump like that. And Trump knows this, thats why he gave that speech in front a 90% white audience. He was afraid of how we would respond because he knew the hour was late, he needed a favor and we were not happy to see him. He did try and counsel with some black pastors but the ones he chose have little to no reach in the national black market.</span>
			<br/><br/>
			<span style='letter-spacing:1px;font-size:14px;'>Personally Trump did not say enough to us to show me my vote or people were relevant to him. And that speech was deliciously insensitive. I'm sure he touched a handful of black voters but I don't believe it will be nearly enough to turn the tide of the election. To bad because some of his ideas were interesting to me. But his total lack of respect for us as a whole cannot be overlooked. Especially without promises. You can't show up this late empty handed and all Trump has in hands right now is sweat.</span>
			<br/><br/>
			<span style='letter-spacing:1px;font-size:14px;'>Here is what Trump can do. If he wins, make good on his promise to fix what he said he would fix. If he does that he will have our attention the next time out just like he promised. But as for today I don't feel any better about Trump after hearing his speech so I will not be voting for him.</span>
