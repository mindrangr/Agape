Especially in light of the CIA's allegations of the Kremlin hacking into the DNC. At present these allegations are just that, allegations and nothing more. Neither the CIA nor any other government related intelligence organization has produced any hard evidence to support bringing formal charges against Russia. I anticipate a committee to be formed and a broader investigation into this matter in the near future, but today their isn't even an infrastructure to determine what should be done if we found them guity. Should there be sanctions? A military response? Revenge hack?<br/><br/>

			<div><img src='newsImages/flynn.jpg' height="200" align='right'  style='padding:4px;padding-top:0px;padding-right:10px;' />So right now, we're still figuring out what to do. But what is most concerning is Trumps complete rejection of information coming directlty from our own intelligence community regarding Russia. His confidence that Russia did not hack our networks is a little too high for someone with no other related intel. And his dismissal of teh actitself is How could he know for sure?<br/><br/>Even without a smoking gun, the intelligence community often briefs the president on findings or relevant intel based on their analysis. Of course it is at the presidents discretion what he does with this information. Usually, though the response has not been to publically accuse the intelligence community of colluding against him. Trump is figuratively screaming 'liar liar pants on fire' to his own intelligence community while in the next breath refusing to say one disparging word about Putin.<br/><br/>The Media immediately sensed his reluctance to criticize Putin and attacked it like a shark near a bloody seal. Trump confirmed all of our suspicions of duplicity by responding to a press comment about Putin being a 'killer' by saying that <i>"Americas hands aren't clean either!"</i>. Really? While no American truly believes that we are the apex of all that is good, that answer was uniformly disloyal and unpresidential to many Americans. The unpresidential part, we get. But Trumps campaign was kind of birthed from a "I'm one of you guys" perspective. The more we see him, the more we know he isn't one of us at all</div>
			<br/><br/>

			<div>Now we have the Former National Security Advisor, Michael Flyn resigning after it became clear that he had conversations with high level Russian offcials prior to the election and then advising the vice president that he hadn't. The white house accepted Flynns resignation but we're all wondering why they didn't force him to resign until it became public. The white house became aware of Flynn illicit activities a month ago and did nothing. This looks bad. The spin doctor Kelly Anne wearily tried to tackle the subject on Tucker but failed at convincing many that one thing is not connected to another.<br/><br/>The more spin the white house generates, the less credibility they have and right now Trumps team suffers from serious credibility issues. Sadly, we all know that all politicians lie and Trump is riding that horse harder and faster than I've seen a president ride before. Where? No one knows yet. But make no mistake about it his intentions will become clear. If its to clear Russia or reduce its sanctions, boy is Trump going to have a big fight with America.<br/><br/>This has only been the first 30 days but wow, this administration is digging itself into a deep deep hole. God, please bless America.</div>
