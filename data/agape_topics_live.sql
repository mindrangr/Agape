He was a military veteran who had served in Afghanistan, and he kept an arsenal in his home that included bomb-making materials.<br><br>\r\nThe gunman turned a demonstration against fatal police shootings this week of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana from a peaceful march focused on violence committed by officers into a scene of chaos and bloodshed aimed against them.<br><br>\r\nThe shooting was the kind of retaliatory violence that people have feared through two years of protests around the country against deaths in police custody, forcing yet another wrenching shift in debates over race and criminal justice that had already deeply divided the nation.<br><br>\r\nTwo witnesses to the shooting at a march against police brutality on Thursday evening in Dallas described the moment gunfire and panic broke out. Five police officers were killed. <br><br>\r\nDemonstrations continued Friday in cities across the country, with one of the largest taking place on the streets of Atlanta, where thousands of people protesting police abuse brought traffic to a standstill.<br><br>\r\nJeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, said in New York that there was apparently just one sniper, though there were so many gunshots and so many victims that officials at first speculated about multiple shooters.<br><br>\r\nOfficials said they had found no evidence that the gunman, Micah Johnson, 25, had direct ties to any protest or political group, either peaceful or violent, but his Facebook page showed that he supported the New Black Panther Party, a group that has advocated violence against whites, and Jews in particular.<br><br>\r\nSearching the killer’s home on Friday, “detectives found bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition, and a personal journal of combat tactics,” the Dallas Police Department said in a statement.<br><br>\r\nThree other people were arrested in connection with the shooting, but the police would not name them or say why they were being held.<br><br>\r\nIn addition to the five officers who died, seven officers and two civilians were wounded. The Police Department said that 12 officers had returned fire during a wild series of gun battles that stretched for blocks.<br><br>\r\nAfter the shooting subsided, Mr. Johnson, wielding an assault rifle and a handgun, held the police off for hours in a parking garage, claiming — apparently falsely — to have planted explosives in the area, and threatening to kill more officers. In the end, the police killed him Friday morning with an explosive delivered by a remote-controlled robot, the Dallas police chief, David O. Brown, said.<br><br>\r\nDuring the standoff, Mr. Johnson, who was black, told police negotiators that “he was upset about Black Lives Matter,” Chief Brown said. “He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.”<br><br>\r\nMr. Johnson, who lived in the Dallas area, served as a private in the Army Reserve from March 2009 to April 2015, according to records released by the Pentagon. He was listed as a carpentry and masonry specialist, and served in Afghanistan from November 2013 to July 2014.<br><br>\r\nThe sequence of events this week provoked anger and despair, dealing blows both to law enforcement and to peaceful critics of the police, who have fended off claims that the outcry over police shootings foments violence and puts officers’ lives in danger.<br><br>\r\n“All I know is that this must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens,” Chief Brown said.', 'Wisp007', '2016-07-20 05:30:46', 0, '[]', 0, 0, 'the Wisp', 'newsImages/policeshooting.png', 5522, 5522, '{"groups":["Current Events"]}', 'Article', 'None', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'Active', '[]'),

In the past the UK had enjoyed substantial benefits as part of being a member of the EU. However now that the tide is turning they are taking to their heels.\nHowever I view it, I do not blame the UK for wanting to leave. Of all the members of the EU, the UK suffers the worst disadvantages of being a member. From the high cost of membership which runs into £15 billion annually and the rising issue of Net Immigration which is amounting to congestion, high cost of housing and inflation. These amongst other factors have Britons worried as to their future. <br><br>\nBut what will the future look like without UK in the EU?\nBill Bryson a renowned US born author was quoted as saying that\n “Now, the British have become more greedy and selfish, more like the American model, except they haven’t quite mastered it yet.”\nHe referred to the decision to leave the EU as more of an emotional decision rather than a logical one.<br><br>\nTo a large extent I am forced to agree with Bill Bryson the Domino effect of UK leaving the EU will soon sweep through Europe. UK is one of the largest economies and contributors to the EU, one of the most popular and out spoken countries in the EU.

Pokemon appear on a player’s mobile device as they walk around. Players can then capture them by throwing PokeBalls at them. This free app was designed by The Pokémon Company and Niantic. Niantic designs used data from Google maps to create a realistic, virtual environment for the pokemon directly on the players mobile device. \n<br/><br/>\nEven more creative are Pokestops which are actual(not virtual) locations where a player can get special bonus accessories for his Pokemon.

(7, '2016-07-25 14:00:00', 'David Clarke: The wrong guy for the job', 'The more I see David Clarke, the more that I just don''t like him. I know that I''m supposed to be enamored by anyone in a blue uniform that claims to wake up in the morning kiss their spouse goodbye and then sprints off to protect me yada yada, but I''m not buying the narrative. The rhetoric of David Clarke doesn''t feel at its core like the sincere anger of a just police officer grieving over the deaths of his fellow cops. His language suggests to me that he&#39;s mostly offended over the racial accusations leveled at his occupation than he is by people with the same skin as his own being killed unjustly by his fraternity brothers. His loyalty for to the police burns hotter than his commitment to justice for all for the people. David Clarke in a single phrase is corrupted by the badge and because of that his message of love rings hollow.\n<br/><br/>\nDavid Clarke&#39s language and his talking points are neither friendly nor progressive. Afterall, what is original about a cop announcing to the world that cops are greatest souls on the earth? Or that black on black crime is a suitable deflection for discussing systemic racism, or that their methods, while not perfect, shouldn&#39;t be altered because the deaths of a few innocent blacks isn&#39;t worth changing the entire system for. This is the very same cop message from 40 years ago when Huey P Newton had young men in California take arms against the police because the violence the police perpetuated against them had reached a point where fighting was preferable to the option of being murdered in silence. That is David Clarke in a nutshell. Not a man of the people, but a police to the core. When cornered by Fox&#39;s Megyn Kelley about whether the blue wall of silence overall was bad for the people, David Clarke couldn''t muster the necessary courage to even acknowledge what everybody already knows. Just the standard deflective hemming and hawing about police rising to defend peoples rights to protest, while in the next breath calling those same people subhuman vermin. \n<br/><br/>\nEven  When the department of justice confirmed that there was racism present in the police department, Clarke crows that they are all liars. According to David Clarke, even president Obama is lying about racism. Apparently, all of these protests are just a part of some huge conspiracy to railroad all cops. Except there is no such conspiracy. David Clarke is a uniformed loon lashing out at protestors. No amount of merit badges he wears can take the ugly out of that. Nothing is more un-American than a cop who loves cops more than the constituency he is tasked to serve. Such men are not credits to our society but hired guns whose allegiance is to their gang. Cop gangs are every bit as repulsive as street gangs and I never weep when a gang member dies. \n<br/><br/>\nSince any language disparaging black Americans, immigrants or women used by a person to describe their own demographic is rewarded heavily by the Republican party the obvious next step would be for the RNC to invite the toxic Clarke to speak. And speak he did. Blathering on and on about how awful Black Lives Matters is, President Obama is a racist and of course the bolded republican talking points about making America great. All the things that his very ideology rejects. An organization that loves cops more than its citizens will never be great. A nation that rejects their own people for protesting bad treatment by its government will never be great. Somehow Republicans have found both of these poisonous ideologies packaged in one person David Clarke and they now proudly wave this man around like a flag of peace. \n<br/><br/>\nThe final insult would be laughable if the GOP wasn''t serious. They contracted David Clarke to write blogs to attract African Americans to the republican party? WTF?? Seriously, his blog is entitled, "Sheriff David Clarke: My message for America’s black community – It’s time to leave the Democratic Party". Dude is a cartoon. Here is the link <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/07/26/sheriff-david-clarke-my-message-for-america-s-black-community-it-s-time-to-leave-democratic-party.html" target="_blank">Leave the democratic party black man...and come to the dark side.</a>\n<br/><br/>\nListen republican party, David Clarke doesn''t have a message for black Americans. Black people won&#39t follow this man anyplace. Why? Because, we don''t trust blacks who can''t recognize racism when they see it. Seems like that is the main prerequisite for African Americans to get into the republican party. Its not that everything needs to be about racism, but when a black police announces that police stopped being racist against black Americans in the 60&#39;s, his credibility is immediately shot to hell beyond recovery. If David Clarke were an actual black man instead of just a cop whose skin is brown, he would have known that. He could have warned you guys. But even Clarke didn''t know because he went straight to the black republican motto, "Those other blacks are too stupid to know any better, that&#39;s why you vote democrat". You know the one where black republicans try and make it look like they''re the only people who can read and understand the history behind the party system. The rest of us dumb, non critical thinking niggas are just doing what grampy Tim did right? SMH  But hats off to the republican party, they always seem to find some self hating black man who is so vested in the white community that he''s thrilled to give the speech. Charles Barkley gave it a few years back on ESPN in his now infamous "This is what I tell my white friends speech". Invariably, the similarities between Clarke and Barkley are striking if you look at them. They both love cops, are married to white women, they both hate the voices of African Americans protesting and they both claim to want justice for all but cower when its time to speak on it on behalf of African Americans. These traits are undeniable and inherently unattractive to black voters so any message coming from either of these men will be shot down before it actually takes off.\n<br/><br/>\nMark Twain once said "Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect." I''ll add another piece to it, "Whenever you find yourself on the same side as Donald Trump, Rudi Guiliani and Jesse Lee Peters its time to switch teams". \n<br/><br/>\nSooner or later, African Americans will begin to immigrate to the Republican party but not at the behest of David Clarke. He was the wrong guy with the wrong message. We don''t trust David Clarke. So we must reject your invitation to the republican party post haste. When the republican party gets serious about working with us they should do 2 things:\n<br/><br/>\n1. Find a message to African Americans that will allow us to feel like you care. Insulting everything black is not that message and it will never fail to fail.<br/>\n2. Send a black man to talk to us. Not a black face.', 'Kufu2k', '2016-07-25 00:00:00', 0, '[]', 0, 0, 'Kufu2k', 'newsImages/davidbitchclark.jpg', 5522, 5522, '{"groups":["Politics"]}', 'Article', 'None', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'Active', '[]'),

(10, '2016-07-12 00:00:00', 'Get yours Kevin Durant - I guess..', 'At the risk of sounding like a cranky old man I won''t be ultra critical of Kevin Durant...but I have to be little critical of him going to Golden State. I don''t have anything personal against Kevin Durant he just happens to be the guy who made the move that broke the camels back, as we used to say. Its really the straw, but you know what I mean.\n<br/><br/>\nThe move wasn''t without precedence. Obviously 5 years earlier Lebron James would take his talents to S.Beach. Now as a hardcore Miami Heat fan, you may expect a little hypocrisy on my part. But I''m not going to justify James either. Although I didn''t criticize him after coming, I was adament during that free agency period that we wanted Bosh. I wasn''t really interested in James because my competitive side looked forward to Wade and Bosh taking on James and the Cavs. I''ve liked the alpha match up between Wade - James match up from the time that James and Wade were rookies. \n<br/><br/>\nWhen James joined the Heat, obviously as a fan I was excited at the prospect of all those championships. We''d go down in history as one of the great franchises ever. But 4 years later Lebron James would tuck tail and charge off home after publically promising 7 champion ships. And then I remembered why I didn''t want him in the first place.\n<br/><br/>\nThere is something a little sad about the leagues alphas quitting and running for championship teams to contribute to at such an early point in their career. Competitors used to wait until they were on the sunset of their career before deciding that they may not have enough to win it. But now players are comimg to the conclusion at 27 and 28 years of age, a time when they should still be ascending. I guess the dynamic of the game will always change but there was something about competitiveness that made athletes shine a little brighter than the average man. A part of me assumed that a person couldn''t make it as far as Durant made it without being highly competitive. But there is something to be said about a mans competitiveness who walks away from a team that was 1 game away from the finals to join the team that beat him. It just feels wrong. I know if I were talking to Durant right now he''d have far more compelling reasons for is choice but as a fan the way that I see him has changed. I still consider him to be a very good player. but I can''t see him as one of the alpha players anymore.\n<br/><br/>\nI do think that Durant has lined himself up to win a lot of games and a few championships. Unfortunately, he''ll find out what Lebron James found out in Miami, you''ll never supplant the home grown players as most loved. You will always be just a hired gun in Golden state. The people will love you until the shots stop falling and then it''ll be time to go. There is a small period of reverence that the greats get at the end of their careers such as Kobes last contract with the Lakers and the right to go out on his own terms. Lebrons jersey will be swinging in Quicken Loans Arena in about 10 years. Who will hang Kevin Durants jersey in their arena ? No such future awaits Kevin Durant because he traded his legacy for championships. OKC will not be waiting for Durant to come home like Cleveland waited for Lebron James. Kevin, you made yourself smaller by going to Golden State.\n<br/><br/>\nIn short, I don''t like what Durants choice says to me about him or the new more thoughtful but less alpha player. I don''t like players moving around and disrupting the relationship with the fans to chase rings. It''s his choice though. Kevin has to live with the results. As a fan, well I guess I''ll just have to find another athlete to admire. So go get yours Kevin.

The saying nobody is above the law began to lose its relevance. In 2014 the shooting of Michael Brown an unarmed African- American by Darren Dean William triggered unrest throughout Ferguson leading to peaceful protest, vandalism, looting, rioting and shots fired. As if that was not enough months later a St Louis County grand jury decided not to indict Darren Dean on the grounds that he shot Michael Brown in self-defense.<br/><br/>\r\nWhat was the grand jury thinking? When the very basis for the unrest was that Michael Brown was about to hands up and surrender and yet still he was gunned down by Darren Dean. \r\nFrom that moment the Black Lives Matter movement got more recognition than it actually deserved. People all over the world began to see reasons to their plight and the injustices practiced by the police. The movement with more popularity and public sympathy on its side, thus grew bolder, stronger, famous and like every famous movement- it inspires public outrage, hate and displeasure with the thing of which they are campaigning against which is the POLICE.<br/><br/>\r\nYes I can say boldly that Black lives matters has gone more than a long way in inciting recent police violence. It has created a wave of not just discontentment with the police but an effect often referred as the Ferguson effect that has made many law enforcement officers truant to their duties. <br/><br/>\r\nBlack Lives matter is to be held accountable for recent violence against the police. This is very clear for all to see. The more popular and powerful a movement is, the more public sentiments it generates. Micah Xavier Johnson an Army Reserve Afghan war veteran went haywire and opened fire on Police officers killing five and injuring nine others. This happened shortly after a Black Lives Matter protest.  The Government should address the issues of Black Lives Matter and make it as public as possible. Appease the misgivings of the people against the police and put an end to a possible escalation of violence against the Police.', 'Wisp007', '2016-07-29 04:25:09', 2, '[]', 0, 0, 'Wisp007', 'newsImages/blacklivesmatter1.jpg', 5522, 5522, '{"groups":["Current Events","Politics"]}', 'Article', 'None', 'New York', 'New York', 'Active', '[]'),

The initial police narrative of the incidence sounded so much like a made up story. I knew in my heart that Charles Kinsey must have done everything right. Here is a man that has given his life to the support of his Community, a good man and a father of five.<br/><br/>\r\nWhat could he possibly do to deserve being shoot and left on the streets to bleed out for over 20 minutes before been attended to? <br/><br/>\r\nThe police, like who they are, came up with a trumped-up story that Officer Jonathan Aledda was trying to protect Charles Kinsey from Rios-soto a 23 years old Autistic patient. The police indicated that Rios-soto was reported to be armed and was trying to kill himself. \r\nHowever, when new evidences came to light, it became blatantly clear that the police were obviously confused.\r\nThe 911call that reported Rios-soto the 23 year old autistic patient emphasized that he might not be armed.<br/><br/>\r\nA cellphone video of the shooting shows without a doubt that Charles Kinsey did everything right.  In the video Kinsey is seen telling police, "All he has is a toy truck. A toy truck. I am a behavior therapist at a group home." Kinsey is also shown telling his patient, "Please be still... lay down on your stomach."<br/><br/>\r\nThe officer on scene Jonathan Aledda has serious questions to answer and he should be facing trial, not going on some administrative leave, eating, getting paid and growing fat.\r\nThis is an obvious case of misjudgment on the part of Jonathan Aledda. I don’t think he shoot Charles Kinsey because he was black, I think he opened fire without thinking properly, I think he is a trigger happy policeman who did not think of the consequences of his actions, but just acted on an inkling that someone might be armed, without seeing to confirm for himself.<br/><br/> After the shooting the officer still did not come back to his senses. He should have treated Charles Kinsey for the apparent injuries which he himself caused. Instead, the officer doubled down on his mistakes by cuffing the shot man and adminstering no aid. For this Officer Jonathan Aledda should be trialed and punished accordingly.
